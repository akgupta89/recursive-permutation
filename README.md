# Recursive Permutations (Javascript)
Solution of a permutation program written in JavaScript. Recursive implementation, adding a new possible character placement to add to the total permutations on each recursive call.

### Problem
Given a word, write a function that generates all possible permutations for a given word, and optionally only list the unique permutations.

### Example
- f("cat") = ["cat", "cta", "tca", "act", "atc", tac"]
